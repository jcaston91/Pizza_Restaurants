# Pizza_Restaurants

Note: This is one of my first projects that I created and experimented with. This is my plan and approach that I plan to take with this dataset. Some things may change as I dive deeper into the dataset.

•	Introduction
I have a data set about pizza, because we all love pizza. The data set runs through many over 3500 pizzas from a number of different restaurants. The data was provided by Datafiniti's Business Database, but collected on Kaggle. It is important to note that this is only a sample data set just and to get the full data set you could go through Datafiniti. Pizza interest me because it feels that every different region has their style of pizza along with their styles of toppings.  
•	Questions
1.	What are the least and most expensive cities for pizza?
2.	What is the number of restaurants serving pizza per capita (100,000 residents) across the U.S.?
3.	What is the median price of a large plain pizza across the U.S.?
4.	Which cities have the most restaurants serving pizza per capita (100,000 residents)?
•	Approach
My approach would be to clean the data first. I think that there are some columns that are not needed as much for my analysis. Then I think that it would be best to group the data in a way so that we could better see it visually and statistically. This would help us further narrow down how popular some pizza is or is it just the place that is more popular.
•	Addressing the problem
I believe that this approach would be great at addressing the problem and answering some of the questions that I have presented. Since pizza is such a hit with many people I think that the data would not have as many outliers 
•	Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/pizza-restaurants-and-the-pizza-they-sell
•	Required packages
1.	ggplot2
2.	stats
3.	readr
•	Plots
Plots that would be great visually would be scatter and bar for better visualization 
•	Future knowledge
I think something that I would like to learn a little more on that I could apply here is more predictive modeling. This would help me predict the possible revenue that one of the locations could make in X more months.
